# BeyondChat Assignment

Assignment project - Article scraper and enhancer.

## What I'm building

- Backend API to scrape and store articles from BeyondChats blog
- Script to enhance articles using AI
- Frontend to display and compare articles

## Tech Stack

Using Node.js instead of Laravel because:
- Same language for everything (JS)
- Easier to integrate with the enhancement script
- I'm more comfortable with it

## Progress

- [ ] Backend API
- [ ] Enhancement Script
- [ ] Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

- GET `/api/articles` - Get all articles
- GET `/api/articles/:id` - Get one article
- POST `/api/articles` - Create article
- PUT `/api/articles/:id` - Update article
- DELETE `/api/articles/:id` - Delete article
- POST `/api/articles/scrape` - Scrape BeyondChats blog
